<h1>Prepare Custom Widgets for Theming</h1>
<p>
  Once you wrote a custom widget, you might want to allow your users to customize
  some aspects of its presentation.
  To do so, you have to provide a couple of resources that are relevant for the
  theming and register the widget with the extension point
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.themeableWidgets</code>.
  The resources must conform to a naming convention so that they can be found.
  Once a custom widget is registered with the extension point, they are
  located by their name.
</p>

<h2>Extension Point themeableWidgets</h2>
<p>
  You have to register your custom RWT widget with the extension point
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.ui.themeableWidgets</code>.
  As a result of the resolve-by-name strategy, only the custom widget class must
  be registered.
  The following is an example of a themeable widget extension definition:
  <pre>
   &lt;extension
         point=&quot;org.eclipse.rap.ui.themeableWidgets&quot;&gt;
      &lt;widget
            id=&quot;my.custom.datepicker&quot;
            class=&quot;my.custom.controls.DatePicker&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/widget&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
  </pre>
</p>

<h2>Resources that are relevant for Theming</h2>
<p>
  The custom widget must provide the theme-relevant resources in a package which
  is named after the schema
  <code>&lt;internal-package&gt;.&lt;widget&gt;kit</code>
  where 
  <code>&lt;internal-package&gt;</code>
  is the package name with the segment "internal" inserted somewhere in the path
  and
  <code>&lt;widget&gt;</code>
  is the lower case class name of the custom widget.
  For example, if your custom widget is <code>my.custom.XWidget</code>, you must
  create a package
  <code>my.custom.internal.xwidgetkit</code>
  or attribute
  <code>my.internal.custom.xwidgetkit</code>
  for your files.
  By the way, if you are already familiar with the concept of life-cycle adapters
  (LCAs), they reside in the very same package.
</p>

<p>
  Theming relevant resources include:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A <strong>theme adapter class</strong> that provides a bridge between your
      theming and SWT.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <strong>theme definition file</strong> that defines new theming keys for
      your widget.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <strong>appearance fragment file</strong> which defines new qooxdoo
      appearances.
    </li>
  </ul>
  None of these resources are mandatory, resources which are found are respected,
  but those which are missing do not hurt.
  For more complex widgets, you might also need to provide a JavaScript file of
  its own to be passed to client side. However, those are additional resources
  which are not automatically discovered but must be registered manually.
</p>

<h3>Theme Adapter</h3>
  This is a class that implements the interface
  <code>org.eclipse.rwt.theme.IControlThemeAdapter</code>.
  The name must match the pattern <code>&lt;Widget&gt;ThemeAdapter</code>.
  You must provide such a class if your custom widget's default values for
  background color, foreground color, font, or border width differ from the
  defaults of its superclass.

<h4>What's the use of the Theme Adapter?</h4>
<p>
  Your custom widget will always be an (indirect) descendant of the class
  <code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control</code>.
  This class defines a couple of getter methods, which must be aware of the
  widget's default values, which depend on the current theme.
  Namely, this includes the methods
  <ul>
    <li>getBackground(),</li>
    <li>getForeground(),</li>
    <li>getFont(), and</li>
    <li>getBorderWidth().</li>
  </ul>
  If a custom value has been set for one of these properties using the according
  setter method, the getters will simply return this value.
  But if either no custom value has been set or the value has explicitly been set
  to <code>null</code>, the widget displays its default and the getters must
  reflect the actual state of the widget.
  For example, if your custom widget has a light gray background by default, the
  method <code>getBackground</code> should return this color instead of
  <code>null</code>.
  The value can depend on the particular instance of the widget, e.g. a widget
  created with the style flag <code>SWT.BORDER</code> might be displayed with a
  different border than one without this flag.
  In order to provide the <code>Control</code> class with the necessary
  information, you have to implement the theme adapter.
</p>

<h3>Theme Definition File</h3>
<p>
  The theme definition file is an XML-file with the name
  <code>&lt;Widget&gt;.theme.xml</code>.
  You must provide this file if you want to define new theming keys which allow
  to make certain aspects of your widget's presentation configurable.
  Its contents must conform with the schema that is outlined by the following
  example:
  <pre>
&lt;theme&gt;
   &lt;color name="mywidget.background"
         description="Background color for MyWidget"
         default="248, 248, 255"/&gt;

   &lt;border name="mywidget.border"
         description="Default border for MyWidget"
         default="1 black"/&gt;

   &lt;image name="mywidget.active.bgimage"
         description="Background image for title bar of active Shells"
         default="resource/images/mywidget_bg.png"/&gt;

   ...
&lt;/theme&gt;
  </pre>
  The root element is named <code>theme</code> and contains one or more elements
  that define new theming keys.
  The possible types are:
  <ul>
    <li>Color (<code>color</code>)</li>
    <li>Dimension (<code>dimension</code>)</li>
    <li>Box Dimension (<code>boxdim</code>)</li>
    <li>Border (<code>border</code>)</li>
    <li>Font (<code>font</code>)</li>
    <li>Image (<code>image</code>)</li>
  </ul>
  Every definition must provide the following attributes:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>name</code>: contains the name of the key.
      This name can be freely chosen, but to avoid conflicts, it should start with the
     custom widget name.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>description</code>: contains a description that allows the user to
      understand which aspects of the widget are affected by this key.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>default</code> contains the default value for this theming key in a
      valid format (see the article on <a href="./theming.html">RWT Theming</a>) for
      format definitions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>targetPath</code>: (optional) only for images, this attribute
      <del>must</del> <add>can</add> specify a target path to copy the image to.
      Within the qooxdoo appearance theme, you can later refer to the image using the
      path <code>widget/&lt;targetPath&gt;</code>.<br/>
      <strong>Update:</strong> Since RAP 1.1, this attribute is optional.
      It might be dropped completely in the future.
      If you don't specify a targetPath, it is automatically set to the key
      given in the attribute <code>name</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Appearance Fragment</h3>
<p>
  The appearance fragment file is a piece of JavaScipt code to be included in the
  qooxdoo appearance theme.
  For details on the qooxdoo theming, refer to
  <a href="http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/theme_support#defining_appearance_themes">http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/theme_support</a>,
  especially the section on appearances.
  The appearance fragment file must have the name <code>&lt;Widget&gt;.appearances.js</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Normally, the contents of the file are directly included in the appearance
  section of the generated qooxdoo theme file.
  Unfortunately, some JavaScript editors might generate warnings as the file
  contains only a fragment and not a complete valid JavaScript program.
  In this case, you can surround the fragment with some extra dummy code that
  makes your JavaScript editor happy.
  The fragment to be actually included must be enclosed in two lines that contain
  the words <code>BEGIN TEMPLATE</code> and <code>END TEMPLATE</code> as shown in
  the example below.
  If these lines are present, only the lines in between are included in the
  appearance theme.
  <pre>
appearances = {
// BEGIN TEMPLATE //

  "my-custom" : {
    style : function( states ) {
      var tv = new org.eclipse.swt.theme.ThemeValues( states );
      return {
        border : tv.getBorder( states.rwt_BORDER ? "mycontrol.BORDER.border" : "mycontrol.border" ),
        backgroundColor : tv.getColor( "mycontrol.background" ),
        padding : tv.getBoxDimension( "mycontrol.padding" ),
        backgroundImage : tv.getImage( "mycontrol.background.image" )
      }
    }
  }

// END TEMPLATE //
};
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  In the above example, the state <code>rwt_BORDER</code> signals that the
  <code>SWT.BORDER</code> style flag is set.
  This state is not automatically available.
  It must explicitly be set in the life-cycle adapter (LCA).
  If you don't provide an LCA on your own, this is done in the LCA of your super
  class (usually CompositeLCA), otherwise it is your responsibility to make the
  required states available.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Update:</strong>
  Since RAP 1.1M3, you should not refer to the names of colors, borders,
  and fonts in your appearance. Also, the makro <code>THEME_VALUE()</code> is
  obsolete.
  To refer to theme values, use an instance of the class ThemeValues as shown in
  the example above.
  This class transforms all types of theme values in a format suitable for the
  qooxdoo appearance theme.
  Moreover, it supports widget variants and tries to resolve the variant value
  first.
