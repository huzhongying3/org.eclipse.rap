  <h1>How to deploy a RAP application to a servlet container?</h1> 
  
  <p>The current eclipse build tools and wizards do not directly support 
  building this style of application so for the time being the build can be
  performed with a series of Ant scripts and resource templates. The 
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> shows how to create a <code>WAR</code> that
  contains the <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo</code> project as RAP application.</p>
  
  <p>Note: As with RCP applications there are a wide variety of possible
  configurations. What's given in <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> is
  just one possibility.</p>
  
  <p>As prerequisites we assume that you are familiar with the bundles- and 
  build information section of the 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/server/http_in_container.php">
  Equinox in a Servlet Container</a> document. We also assume that you checked
  out the 
  <a href="servletbridge-anon.psf">servlet bridge and demo feature bundles</a>
  in your workspace. The link points to a 'team project set' file. 
  In case you haven't done that so far, use <b>File</b> 
  &gt; <b>Import</b> &gt; <b>Team Project Set</b> and enter the location of
  the downloaded file. Press <b>Finish</b> and the necessary 
  projects will be imported from CVS.</p>
  
  <h3>Prepare the build script</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Open the <code>script/webappBuilder.xml</code> of the
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> with the Ant editor.</li>
  <li>Adjust the <code>servletbridge.dir</code> property
  (see docu in script file).</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="../../images/script.png">
  
  <h3>Create the build content</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Right-Click on the <code>webAppBuilder.xml</code> script in the IDE and 
      "Run Ant". (Note: In order to make the <code>pde.exportFeatures</code> task
      available in the IDE select "Run in the same JRE as the workspace" on the
      JRE tab from "Run Ant...").</li>
  <li>Refresh the feature project - a build folder should appear. (Note:
      The <code>pde.exportFeatures</code> target will build the plug-ins
      asynchronously and may take a while till finished. After that the complete 
      <code>WAR</code> content should be available in the build folder.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="../../images/build.png">
  
  <h3>Adjust the <code>config.ini</code></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Adjust the path to the plug-in directory of your build in the
  <code>ConfigIniCreator</code> (see the comment in the 
  <code>ConfigIniCreator</code> class).</li>
  <li>Run the ConfigIniCreator as java application.</li>
  <li>Copy the console output to the <code>config.ini</code> file of your
  build.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="../../images/config.png">
  
  
  <p>After that, pack the <code>WAR</code> of the application build available in the 
  build folder (in our case the content of <code>build/rapdemo</code>). Deploy
  the <code>WAR</code> to a servlet container to see whether the build was successful :-)</p>

  templates directory for more infos on how activating the console)
  
  <h2>How to deploy my own application?</h2>
  
  <p>To deploy your own application like described above you will have
  to create your own feature. The feature should contain the same plug-in 
  references as the demo feature (except the demo-plug-in of course!) plus the
  plug-ins that make up your application. It is important that your plug-ins
  reference the servlet API by using the <code>Import-Package</code> directive
  instead of the <code>Require-Bundle</code> directive. See the 
  <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> of the demo project for an example.</p>
  
  <p>Copy the script and templates folder to the feature and modifiy them
  according to your project structure. Following the steps above should lead
  to a full functional <code>WAR</code> of your application.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you encounter problems during the build, you
  may consider to use the PDE-Export (available from the feature editor)
  before exporting the whole WAR at once. This proved helpful for
  trouble-shooting as the export may show problem-relevant dialogs that are
  suppressed in the Ant export.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note also</strong>: Besides the application server log files
  there also exists an Equinox framework log that can be found under the webapp's
  work directory, e.g. on Tomcat:
  <pre>
  <code>&lt;tomcat-installation&gt;\work\Catalina\localhost\demo\eclipse\workspace\.metadata\.log</code>
  </pre>
  In case equinox isn't able to start at all, you may also look for log files 
  at:
  <pre>
  <code>&lt;tomcat-installation&gt;\work\Catalina\localhost\demo\eclipse\configuration</code>
  </pre>

  </p>
