<h1>RWT Overview and Comparison to SWT</h1>
<p>The first two chapters outlined below are a copy of the table of content of 
  the famous SWT book by Steve Northover and Mike Wilson. We think that the 
  lecture of this book is very useful if you would like to implement 
  applications with RWT, as it lays out all the concepts and gives examples. 
  The third chapter provides an overview over the widgets that can be found in 
  the <code>custom</code> package. As RWT is intended to work as much as 
  possible like SWT we only document the differences between RWT and SWT in 
  the chapters below.</p>
<p>RWT is work in progress and we will update this document with our 
  implementation progress. The most recent version of this document can be found
  at the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/RWTOverview">RAP Wiki</a>.
