<h1>19 Images</h1>

<a name="Class_ImageData"></a><h3>Class ImageData</h3>
<p>Not yet implemented. 
Although we plan to implement the ImageData functionality the RWT developer needs to be aware of the fact that the image manipulation takes place on the server-side. 
To display an image in the application (browser) it needs to be persistent and accessible by a link to the server.

<a name="Class_Image"></a><h3>Class Image</h3>
<p>Image is implemented, but with a different API. The RWT image references only the path to the image.
