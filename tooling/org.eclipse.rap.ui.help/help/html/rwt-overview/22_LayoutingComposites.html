<h1>22 LayoutingComposites</h1>

<a name="CTabFolder"></a><h3>CTabFolder</h3>
<p>As this widgets is used heavily by the web workbench it is (almost) feature complete, though not bug free:(
</p><p>Only the <code>!SIMPLE</code> style is missing, and probably will be for a log time.
</p>
<a name="SashForm"></a><h3>SashForm</h3>
<p>'Implemented' as copy-from-SWT-with-minor-changes.
</p>
<a name="StackLayout"></a><h3>StackLayout</h3>
<p>Implemented. We copied the source-code from SWT and it simply works&nbsp;:-)
</p>
<a name="ViewForm"></a><h3>ViewForm</h3>
<p>Implemented sufficiently for the web workbench to work.
</p>
<a name="ScrolledComposite"></a><h3>ScrolledComposite</h3>
<p>A basic implementation exists. The client-side support for scroll bars is very basic and therefore are the capabilities of the current ScrolledComposite implementation.
</p><p>As the current implementation reaches its barriers we can re-implement the current ScrolledComposite to use dedicated client-side scroll bars that allow more control over scrolling behavior. But nonetheless you won't have the same fine-grained control as in SWT.
</p>
<a name="CBanner"></a><h3>CBanner</h3>
<p>A very basic implementation exists right now. As CBanner is used in the web workbench we will enhance it as required by the workbench.
