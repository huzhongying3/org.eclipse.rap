<h1>3 The Mouse</h1>

<a name="Mouse_Events"></a><h3>Mouse Events</h3>
<p>Many of the Mouse Events will most likely not be implemented in RWT. Due to its distributed nature and associated network latency those events would be very difficult to use consistently. 
</p><p><b>Don't be afraid:</b> We are not talking about Double-Clicks and Selection (see below), which are / will be available. Context menus are also available.
</p>
<a name="Selection"></a><h3>Selection</h3>
<p>RWT implements the same selection behavior as SWT.
Default selection semantics are planned but not yet available.
