<a name="Fonts"></a><h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>We are facing similar problems with platform-independent font code as SWT does. It is even worse as we don't have access to the available fonts on the system that is displaying the application. Choose your fonts carefully.

<a name="Class_Font"></a><h3>Class Font</h3>
<p>The Font class is somewhat different from SWT. We share fonts application wide and therefore there is no constructor but a static <code>getFont(String,int,int)</code> method to create and/or obtain a font. However the three parameters should be familiar as they denote the name, size and style of the font.
