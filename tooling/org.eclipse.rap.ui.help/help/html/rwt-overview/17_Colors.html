<h1>17 Colors</h1>

<a name="Class_RGB"></a><h3>Class RGB</h3>
<p>Works the same as in SWT.
</p>
<a name="Class_Color"></a><h3>Class Color</h3>
<p>Behaves the same as in SWT.
Since there are no operating system resources allocated when creating a Color 
object, the RWT Color class does not have a <code>dispose()</code> method.
To reduce memory footprint, the constructors were replaced by static mathods
that return shared Color instances.
</p>
<a name="System_Colors"></a><h3>System Colors</h3>
<p>Constants for 'natural' colors are defined in RWT and <code>Display.getSystemColor()</code> returns an instance of class Color for
those.
</p><p>Window system-specific colors such as <code>COLOR_WIDGET_BORDER</code> are not yet implemented.
