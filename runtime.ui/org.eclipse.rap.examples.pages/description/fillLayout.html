  <h2>FillLayout</h2>

  <p>
  The FillLayout is the simplest layout in SWT.
  It lays out the children of its parent in one single row,
  either horizontally or vertically.
  It forces all children to be the same size.
  Margins and spacings can be specified.
  </p>
  <p>
  A FillLayout can be used to lay out buttons in a tool bar, or to stack
  checkboxes in a group.
  For parents that have only one single child, a FillLayout can be used to
  let the child completely fill its parent.
