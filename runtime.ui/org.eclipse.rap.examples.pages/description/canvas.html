  <h2>Canvas</h2>

  <p>
    With the help of a <code>GC</code> it is possible to draw on a 
    <code>Canvas</code> widget.
    The usual functions like dots, lines, (rounded) rectangles, ovals, polylines, 
    arcs, text and images are supported. All shapes can be outlined or (when 
    closed) filled with any color and opacity.
