1.) Sometimes Checkbox and Radioboxes do not change their 'checked'-depiction
although the user clicked the component. The event triggered by the user-action
seemed to be fired though. See Window1 online example.

2.) Is there a possibility to fire resize events directly? We currently use
changeHeight and changeWidth for emulation.

3.) The label of a button does not automatically clip in case the size of the
label is bigger than the size of the button's box. The same seems to be the
case for a label widget.

4.) How to properly dispose of widgets? widget.dispose() seems not sufficient.
In case of a shell, it stays visible but unusable, when trying to dispose of
a text field that way nothing happens. Calling hide() before disposing of the
widget seems to work. Is there more to take care of?

5.) What is the difference between qx.ui.tree.Tree and 
qx.ui.treefullcontrol.Tree? ...tree.Tree seems not able to hide the root node,
that's right?

6.) TextArea doesn't accept the wrap attribute

7.) Color settings for table component are static contstants

8.) TreeFullControl sends selection event when expanding/collapsing node.

9.) Disposing of a currently visible toolTip fails with the following errors:
  ERROR: qx.ui.popup.ToolTip[632]: Modification of property "visibility" failed 
  with exception: TypeError - this._hideTimer has no properties
  ERROR: qx.manager.object.ToolTipManager[42]: Modification of property 
  "currentToolTip" failed with exception: TypeError - this._showTimer has 
  no properties

10.) Button overwrites custom backgroundColor and border after mouse over.

11.) Initial positioning of scrollbars (e.g. setScrollLeft) does not work

12.) How to make a qx.ui.form.TextField read-only?
