1.) Sometimes Checkbox and Radioboxes do not change their 'checked'-depiction
although the user clicked the component. The event triggered by the user-action
seemed to be fired though. See Window1 online example.

2.) Is there a possibility to fire resize events directly? We currently use
changeHeight and changeWidth for emulation.

3.) The label of a button does not automatically clip in case the size of the
label is bigger than the size of the button's box. The same seems to be the
case for a label widget.

4.) How to properly dispose of widgets? widget.dispose() seems not sufficient.
In case of a shell, it stays visible but unusable, when trying to dispose of
a text field that way nothing happens. Calling hide() before disposing of the
widget seems to work. Is there more to take care of?

5.) What is the difference between qx.ui.tree.Tree and 
qx.ui.treefullcontrol.Tree? ...tree.Tree seems not able to hide the root node,
that's right?

6.) TextArea doesn't accept the wrap attribute
    --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300

7.) Color settings for table component are static contstants

8.) TreeFullControl sends selection event when expanding/collapsing node.
    --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289

9.) Disposing of a currently visible toolTip fails with the following errors:
  ERROR: qx.ui.popup.ToolTip[632]: Modification of property "visibility" failed 
  with exception: TypeError - this._hideTimer has no properties
  ERROR: qx.manager.object.ToolTipManager[42]: Modification of property 
  "currentToolTip" failed with exception: TypeError - this._showTimer has 
  no properties

10.) Button overwrites custom backgroundColor and border after mouse over.

11.) Initial positioning of scrollbars (e.g. setScrollLeft) does not work

12.) Creating a table on an invisible tab within a tab folder yields error
  message: 
  Modification of property "maximum" failed with exception: TypeError -
  vCurrentChild has no properties

13.) Some parts of a table are drawn not until the first mouse move.

14.) How to make a qx.ui.form.TextField read-only?
     --> SOLVED

15.) Setting font and/or foreground color is ignored when done in the same
     JavaScript chunk in which the widget is created
     --> WORKAROUND IS USED
     
16.) Sometimes, when an empty Text field is focussed and/or blurred using the
     tab key, the getText() method returns the string "null". This is probably
     also a qx problem.

17.) Label drops text in angle brackets
     This also applies to all widgets that internally use labels
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=193

18.) A qx.ui.basic.Atom displaying a wrapped and centered text in its label
     does not align the label properly. It seems that the Boxlayout assumes the
     width of the non-wrapped child.

19.) treefullcontrol causes debug message "Could not load: 
     icon/16/places/folder.png" even though icon and selectedIcon were set
     in TreeRowStructure

20.) What happens with a RadioManager when a Composite with some radio buttons
     gets disposed of? After that radioButton.getMaanger() return null, but
     the RadioManagers' dispose methods seems not to be called.     

21.) Setting the property "icon" on qx.ui.window.Window has no effect. The
     window icon can only be set using the constructor. (Qx Bug 87)

22.) If the property "resizable" is set to false on a qx.ui.window.Window, the
     maximize button is grayed out and the window cannot be maximized even if
     "allowMaximize" is true. (Qx Bug 288)

23.) TreeFullControl: Item expands when clicked
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289
     --> PARTIALLY SOLVED
     
24.) TreeFullControl: when changing an icon or adding an item with a different 
     icon, the icon is not shown the first time. After the item is once selected
     the actual icon is shown.
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=260

25.) Under some (yet not reproducible) circumstances a tooltip for a widget
     does not disappear but stays orphaned even though the associated widget is
     not under the mouse cursor or invisible or disposed of.
     
26.) Gap in border of GroupBox with no legend
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=286
     
27.) TabView should scroll TabButtons
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=287
     
28.) Disable spell check feature on FF 2.0
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=291
     --> WORKAROUND IS USED               
     
29.) List with scrollY overflows in IE7
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299
     
30.) TextArea: wrap property broken
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300
     
31.) Wrap behavior for Spinner
     --> http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301      
     
32.) Checkbox/radio-button focus rectangle discussion 
     (additional issue: what to do when focus was set programmatically?)
     --> news://news.gmane.org:119/emuhs6$fv1$1@sea.gmane.org
     
33.) Scroll ListItem into view
     --> news://news.gmane.org:119/eokqbs$q4n$1@sea.gmane.org
     
34.) Sometimes caret of text box not shown in Firefox
     --> investigate http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/snippets/show_caret_in_dialogs_in_ff     
     
35.) treefullcontrol: when a TreeFolder is created without specifying icons in 
     the underlying RowStructure (e.g. row.addIcon), it is not possible to set 
     icons afterwards.
