/**
 * This class is the abstract superclass of the classes
 * that represent the built in platform dialogs.
 * A <code>Dialog</code> typically contains other widgets
 * that are not accessible. A <code>Dialog</code> is not
 * a <code>Widget</code>.
 * <p>
 * This class can also be used as the abstract superclass
 * for user-designed dialogs. Such dialogs usually consist
 * of a Shell with child widgets.
 * <p>
 * Note: The <em>modality</em> styles supported by this class
 * are treated as <em>HINT</em>s, because not all are supported
 * by every subclass on every platform. If a modality style is
 * not supported, it is "upgraded" to a more restrictive modality
 * style that is supported.  For example, if <code>PRIMARY_MODAL</code>
 * is not supported by a particular dialog, it would be upgraded to 
 * <code>APPLICATION_MODAL</code>. In addition, as is the case
 * for shells, the window manager for the desktop on which the
 * instance is visible has ultimate control over the appearance
 * and behavior of the instance, including its modality.
