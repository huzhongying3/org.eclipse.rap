    The following section is needed to support the new CSS-based theming.
    It describes the elements this widget adds to the virtual element
    tree which the CSS rules relate to.
    Please note that the syntax is considered preliminary and is still subject
    to change. Also note that this section is not interpreted as long as RAP
    uses the old property-based system internally. We publish it here anyway
    to introduce the new syntax to interested developers soon.
